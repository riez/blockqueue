# Block Queue

**Block Queue** is a lightweight and cost-effective queue messaging system with pub/sub mechanism for a cheap, robust, reliable, and durable messaging system.

Crafted atop the robust foundations of [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) and [NutsDB](https://github.com/nutsdb/nutsdb), Block Queue prioritizes efficiency by minimizing network latency and ensuring cost-effectiveness.

## Why BlockQueue

While Kafka, Redis, or SQS is an excellent product, it is quite complex and requires a lot of resources. My purpose is to build this BlockQueue for simplicity, low resources, and cheap.

## Features
- ðŸ’¸ Cost-Effective: Designed with affordability in mind, Block Queue provides a budget-friendly solution for messaging needs.
- ðŸ“¢ Pub/Sub Mechanism: The inclusion of a publish/subscribe mechanism allows for easy communication and real-time updates.
- ðŸ“¶ Less Network Latency: Prioritizing efficiency, Block Queue minimizes network latency to persistence to enhance overall performance.

## How it works
### Create Topic

```bash
curl --location 'http://your-host/topics' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "cart",
    "subscribers": [
        {
            "name": "counter",
            "option": {
                "max_attempts": 5,
                "visibility_duration": "5m"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "created",
            "option": {
                "max_attempts": 5,
                "visibility_duration": "5m"
            }
        }
    ]
}'
```

### Subscriber Options
| Key  | Value | Description |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | --------------------- |
| **max_attempts**         | 1, 2, 3    | max redeliver message |
| **visibility_duration**  | 5m, 6m, 1h | if message not ack yet message, will send **now() + visibility_duration** |

### Create New Subscribers
```bash
curl --location 'http://your-host/topics/cart/subscribers' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '[
    {
        "name": "counter",
        "option": {
            "max_attempts": 5,
            "visibility_duration": "5m"
        }
    }
]
'
```

### Delete Subscriber
```bash
curl --location --request DELETE ''http://your-host/topics/{topic_name}/subscribers/{subscriber_name}'
```

### Publish Message 

```bash
curl --location 'http://your-host/topics/{topic_name}/messages' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "message": "hi message from topic {topic_name}"
}'
```

### Read Message

To read a message, you just need to pass the subscriber name into URL Path and with timeout. This ensures horizontal scalability and guarantees that the message is sent once.

```bash
curl --location 'http://your-host/topics/{topic_name}/subscribers/{subscriber_name}?timeout=5s'
```

> Note: A message at-least-once message delivery.

### Delete Message

After reading and successfully processing a message, you must delete it, as the message will persist based on queue retry policy on subscriber option.

```bash
curl --location --request DELETE 'http://your-host/topics/{topic_name}/subscribers/{subscriber_name}/messages/{message_id}'
```

### Subscriber Message Status

If you want to check how many unpublished or unacked message, you can immediately hit this endpoint
```bash
curl --location 'localhost:8080/topics/{your_topic}/subscribers'
```
